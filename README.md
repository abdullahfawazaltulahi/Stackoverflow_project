here we will develop Big Data Engineering Project on Azure. Data will be ingested from 2 data sources and ingested into the Data Lake in Azure. In the Data Lake, after a couple of data transformation and Machine Learning Model running, we make the Machine Learning result back to the Data Lake. Then we will use Azure Synapse to connect to Lake.
